## Venezuelan Diaspora Analysis

This research project explores the relationship between the geographic distribution of Venezuelans around the world and the origins of their ancestors. As Venezuela has experienced significant waves of immigration and emigration over the decades, this study aims to uncover patterns in where Venezuelans live today and how these locations relate to their ancestral origins.

### Project Description

The study was conducted by collecting primary data through a survey distributed to Venezuelans across various countries. The survey gathered information about participantsâ€™ current locations and their ancestral origins. The analysis focused on grouping the data by continents to identify trends and relationships.

### Key Objectives:

- Data Collection: Gather accurate and relevant data from Venezuelans worldwide through a structured survey.
- Data Analysis: Identify correlations between the current locations of Venezuelans and the regions their ancestors originated from.
- Conclusions: Determine whether a significant relationship exists between these two variables.

### Tools and Technologies

- Python: Used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: Utilized for conducting and documenting the analysis.
- Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and grouping.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: Used for visualizing the data and the results.
- CSV Files: Contain the raw and cleaned survey data.

### Installation

To run this analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git
cd portfolio/venezuelan_diaspora_analysis
```
2. Install Required Libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
- Open the Venezuelan_Diaspora_Analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis. 

### Usage

1. Survey Data: The project includes both raw (survey_results.csv) and cleaned (cleaned_results.csv) survey data.
2. Data Analysis: The Jupyter Notebook (Venezuelan_Diaspora_Analysis.ipynb) contains step-by-step analysis, including data cleaning, grouping by continent, and visualization of the relationships.
3, Results: The analysis reveals a strong correlation between the regions where Venezuelans currently reside and their ancestral origins, particularly when grouped by continent.

### Results

The findings of this project suggest a significant relationship between the geographical locations of Venezuelans today and the regions their ancestors emigrated from. This insight highlights the lasting impact of historical migration patterns on current demographic distributions.
This project was presented as a poster at the Honors & International Education Conference at Lone Star College, Tomball, Texas.

### Future Work

- Expand Data Collection: Distribute the survey more widely to increase the sample size and diversity.
- Deeper Analysis: Conduct further analysis on more granular data, such as by country rather than continent.
- Comparison with Other Diasporas: Compare the Venezuelan diaspora patterns with those of other countries to identify unique or common trends.
