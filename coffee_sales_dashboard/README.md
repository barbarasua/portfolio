# Coffee Sales Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project showcases the creation of a **dynamic, interactive Coffee Sales Dashboard** using **Excel**. The goal was to analyze coffee bean sales data and present it in a user-friendly dashboard using Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, and timelines. The dashboard provides insights into total sales over time, sales by country, and top customers, allowing for easy filtering and customization.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Gathering and Transformation**: Extracted, cleaned, and transformed sales data using **XLOOKUP** and **INDEX MATCH** functions.
- **Pivot Tables & Charts**: Built **pivot tables** to summarize data and used **pivot charts** to visualize sales by product, country, and customer.
- **Slicers and Timeline**: Added interactive **slicers** and a **timeline** for filtering data by roast type, coffee size, and customer loyalty.
- **Final Dashboard**: Consolidated visuals into a well-organized dashboard that enables users to quickly draw insights from the data.

## Key Features
- **Total Sales Over Time**: A **line chart** that visualizes total sales across different coffee types over time.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**
  - **XLOOKUP**, **INDEX MATCH** for data extraction.
  - **Pivot Tables** for data summarization.
  - **Pivot Charts** for data visualization.
  - **Slicers and Timeline** for data filtering.

## Instructions
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - The `Orders` sheet contains raw data. Customer and product information are extracted from the `Customers` and `Products` tables using `XLOOKUP` and `INDEX MATCH`.
